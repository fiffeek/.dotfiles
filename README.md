# .dotfiles

Personal dotfiles managed by Ansible.

I use Ubuntu. [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) is leveraged to make this set up easier
on multiple machines.

## Terminal driven development

Development is done with the help of the three main components:

- [i3](https://i3wm.org/), with the `win` key as the modifier
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki), with `alt` as the pane/window navigator prefix, and `ctrl + space` as the full prefix
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/), with `ctrl` as the window navigation prefix, and `space` as the leader

## Keyboard

Due to extensive RSI I moved to an ortholinear keyboard, [ZSA Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager/).
Any keybinds try to leverage [my layout](https://github.com/fiffeek/qmk-keymap).
